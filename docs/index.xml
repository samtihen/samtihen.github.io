      <description>I have worked as a software engineer since 2004, and have spent most of that time building web applications using a wide variety of programming languages.
I currently work at Enterprise Holdings , where I lead the development of solutions across our Commute , Carshare , and Zimride teams. At EHI, we generally create highly scaleable Java and PHP applications and deploy on AWS intrastructure.
I also run a small software company called Nehit that engages in occasional web application development on a per project basis.</description>

      <description>I am fortunate to be part of an amazing family of four - myself, my wife Christina, and my children Jack and Max. I knew Christina growing up, but she only agreed to marry me after I had matured for an extra decade or so ðŸ¤£. She is a very smart, kind, and exceptionally beautiful woman and I&amp;rsquo;m incredibly lucky to have her!
My first born, Jack, is 5 years old and is a very clever, fun loving preschooler.</description>
