I have worked as a [software engineer](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samtihen/) since 2004, and have spent most of that time building web applications using a wide variety of programming languages.

I currently work at [Enterprise Holdings](https://www.ehi.com/), where I lead the development of solutions across our [Commute](https://www.commutewithenterprise.com/), [Carshare](https://www.enterprisecarshare.ca), and [Zimride](https://www.zimride.com/) teams. At EHI, we generally create highly scaleable Java and PHP applications and deploy on AWS intrastructure.

I also run a small software company called [Nehit](https://www.nehit.com/) that engages in occasional web application development on a per project basis.
