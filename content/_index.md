## Hi there 👋

I'm a [Lead Software Engineer at Enterprise Mobility 🚘](https://www.linkedin.com/in/samtihen/), where I have worked since 2015. I completed a MS in CS at the University of Missouri - Saint Louis in 2022 🎓, with an emphasis in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data science.

I'm passionate about building software of all types 🧑🏻‍💻, and really enjoy mentoring newer developers. I teach [Web Development (CSE 204A)](https://github.com/wustlcse204) at [Washington University in Saint Louis](https://wustl.edu/).

I really enjoy [traveling 🧳](https://www.deviantart.com/samtihen), and was lucky enough to spend my late 20s abroad while working on a [Scuba Diving 🤿](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j4-ncvzolA) startup called [MyScubaDives.com](http://www.myscubadives.com).

Today, I am [married to my high school crush and have two young children 👨‍👩‍👦‍👦](https://www.flickr.com/people/samtihen/) who take up most of my free time.
