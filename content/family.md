I am fortunate to be part of an amazing family of four - myself, my wife Christina, and my children Jack and Max. I knew Christina growing up, but she only agreed to marry me after I had matured for an extra decade or so ðŸ¤£.  She is a very smart, kind, and exceptionally beautiful woman and I'm incredibly lucky to have her!

My first born, Jack, is 6 years old and is a very clever, fun loving kindergartener. He particularly enjoys Minecraft, dinosaurs and werewolves.

My baby, Max, is 3 years old and is the wild one in the family! He loves swords and anything with projectiles.

Both of my children go to school at a Spanish language immersion school in the area.
